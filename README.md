# Bitcoin-MoneyMoney
Fetches amount and value of privately held Bitcoin address via blockexplorer and returns it as a security.
This can be also be used to track your cold storage.

Originally developed by Dr. Johannes Jacubeit. (https://github.com/Jacubeit/Bitcoin-MoneyMoney)
As it was no longer actively maintained I took the liberty to fork it and maintain it further.
